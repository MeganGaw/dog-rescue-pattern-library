      <p class="unit s-1 m-1 l-3-4 gutter-2">Birch Haven Rescue and Rehabilitation Services; located in Eastern Ontario, Canada on 148 acres was founded in 1996 as a personal rescue to assist those Great Danes/other Giant Canine Breeds and Equine animals that have been abandoned, abused, neglected and otherwise mistreated by rescuing, fostering, rehabilitating physically plus behaviourally and then placing them into their forever loving homes.</p>
      <p class="unit s-1 m-1 l-3-4 gutter-2 b-bottom">Dogs are not kenneled outside, they are treated as beloved members of our home and those of our approved temp foster homes.
    Birch Haven also tries to promote responsible pet ownership through Humane Education, Training, Socialization and Community Public Awareness. We are also involved in Therapy work.
    We are very small, private and are committed to personal rescue plus re-homing that is completely financed by monetary gifts, owner surrender plus adoption fees as we do not any receive government, provincial or corporate funding. We are financed mainly out of our own pockets.We also work very hard to assist various breeders, rescue groups, shelters, organizations and friends in placing rescues or re-homing animals that come into their hands. We only organize and facilitate in these situations. </p>
